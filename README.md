1. The codes are archived in three folders according to the dataset, i.e., CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet100.
2. Each sub-folder of the dataset contains all layer-wise refined pruning codes for the corresponding network, including the training codes, the feature map extractiing codes, the layer-wise refined pruning codes, as well as the codes concerning the 50-group-wise-pruning experiment.
3. The folder "FPGA" provides the FPGA-target network file about the pruned model and the corresponding python codes.
4. CIFAR10, CIFAR100 can be obtained online conveniently. In terms of ImageNet100, it can be randomly selected from the whole dataset ImageNet.
