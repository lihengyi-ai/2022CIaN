1. The codes are archieved in three folders according to the dataset, i.e., CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet100.
2. Each sub-folder of the dataset contains the all layer-wise refined pruning codes for the corresponding network, including the training codes, the featuremap extractiing codes, the layer-wise refined pruning codes, as well as the codes concerning the 50-group-wise-pruning experiment.
3. The folder "FPGA" contains the FPGA-target network file and corresponding the python codes.
4. CIFAR10, CIFAR100 can be obtained online conveniently. In terms of ImageNet100, it can be randomly selected from the whole dataset ImageNet.
